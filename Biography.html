<h2>Synopsis of Personal Life</h2>
<body>
        <p>
            I was born on May 18, 2001; in Indianapolis, Indiana. 
            I was born to a modest family with 4 older brothers,and later 2 younger sisters. 
            I contribute my successes in life to my family's shortcomings. 
             Though I have not been given many percieveable advantages in life, I have flipped my shortcomings and made them my strengths. 
             The important lessons I have learned from my shortcomings have given me the iniative, and hardworking aditude that has put me above the competition no matter what I am doing.
