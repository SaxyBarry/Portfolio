<h2>Synopsis of Personal Life</h2>
<body>
        <p>
            I was born on May 18, 2001; in Indianapolis, Indiana. 
            I was born to a modest family with 4 older brothers,and later 2 younger sisters. 
            I contribute my successes in life to my family's shortcomings. 
             Though I have not been given many perceivable advantages in life, I have flipped my shortcomings and made them my strengths. 
             The important lessons I have learned from my shortcomings have given me the initiative, and hardworking attitude that has put me above the competition no matter what I am doing.
             This attitude drove me to get a job at the age of 14 at a pizza kitchen, and from there I started out as a dishwasher and worked my way up to pizza cook; rising above my coworkers by making connections and showing genuine interest in the job.
             My job not only helped me to support my family in harsh times, but also taught me the value in making connections, working hard, and not skipping corners.

<h2>Activities</h2>
<body>
    <p>
        I have done a multitude of school activities that have turned me into who I am today.
        In my past 3 years of highschool and some of middle school I participated in many activities like; 4 years of Marching band, 3 years of Jazz Band, Falcon Leadership Opportunities Through Service (Where seniors go to a 3 day retreat with 5th graders and act as councilors), Link Crew (Introducing 8th graders into the highschool environment), Nextech Catapult Program, and the band program for about 7 years.
        All of these activities have taught me the values of work ethic, leadership, and morals. They have all given me opportunities I never dreamed of as a child, and given me a life I can love.
