<h2>Who I am and Why?</h2>

<body>
    <p>
        I was born on May 18, 2001; in Indianapolis, Indiana. I was born to a modest family with 4 older brothers, and later 2 younger
        sisters. I contribute my successes in life to my family, and the lessons I have learned. The most important advantage
        in my life has been my incredibly supportive parents and siblings; they taught and gave me the ability to turn my
        shortcomings into advantages and use them as lessons. This has given me the initiative, and hardworking attitude
        that has put me above the competition no matter what I am doing. This attitude drove me to get a job at the age of
        14 at a pizza kitchen, and from there I started out as a dishwasher and worked my way up to pizza cook; rising above
        my coworkers by making connections and showing genuine interest in the job. My job not only helped me to support
        my family in harsh times, but also taught me the value in making connections, working hard, and not skipping corners.
        Overall though, the most important lessons I have learened have come from my family; and this has taught me the value
        of relationships and team cohesiveness.

    <h2>Activities</h2>
    <p>
        I have done a multitude of school activities that have turned me into who I am today. In my past 3 years of highschool and
        some of middle school I participated in many activities like; 4 years of Marching band, 3 years of Jazz Band, Falcon
        Leadership Opportunities Through Service (Where seniors go to a 3 day retreat with 5th graders and act as councilors),
        Link Crew (Introducing 8th graders into the highschool environment), Nextech Catapult Program, and the band program
        for about 7 years. All of these activities have taught me the values of work ethic, leadership, and morals. They
        have all given me opportunities I never dreamed of as a child, and given me a life I can love.
